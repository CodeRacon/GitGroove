    <h2>The Story behind</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I'm Micha, frontend developer, music enthusiast... and interested in a lot of things, to say
        the least. Sound generation is on of it and has interested me all my life, in one way or
        another. Of course, this also includes <i>synthetic</i> sound generation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came across <a href="https://eirikbrandal.com/" target="blank">Eirik Brandal</a> by
        chance, which left a lasting impression on me:
        <br />
        Eirik is man, an <i>artist</i> first and foremost, who creates fascinating, living
        sound-sculptures with electronics, perseverance, precision, a steady hand and lots of
        creativity. He was instrumental in turning my initial idea into a finished project. Thank
        you Eirik!
      </p>

      <p>
        But since I don't know much about electronics <i>yet</i>, I had to come up with something I
        can do: A web-app!

          >GitGroove is intended to be a tool for everyone to craft and develop their own personal
          sound-sculpture and their personal sonic narrative.</b
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Project Essence</h3>
      <p>
        GitGroove combines software development and music in an experimental, playful way. Every
        contribution becomes a musical element, where Git metrics are mapped to musical components.
        The result is a harmonious carpet of sound that reflects the development of your projects in
        an entirely new dimension.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Usage Notice</h3>
      <p>
        GitGroove only uses publicly available GitHub contribution data to create its sonic
        patterns. We don't collect or store any private information.
      </p>
